# DynForms

DynForms or Dynamics Forms is a fork of [AOForm](https://github.com/videsk/aoform) that is the first library for create form with a JSON schemas.

---
This library allow to generate forms with a simple JSON schema for modern browsers. The idea comes from generate dynamics forms with a JSON schema provided via REST API for Videsk™.

Was used flexbox for every position of components, generating a totally responsive layout. The interactions with components are designed with 50% CSS and 50% Javascript ES6, this make a really fast and lightweight runtime.

You can set or add your customs styles for every component. In that case we recommend read Custom CSS documentation with detention, because CSS is essential on status, interactions and visuals indicators. But is really ease modify basics styles of elements like `colors`, `radius` and others.
